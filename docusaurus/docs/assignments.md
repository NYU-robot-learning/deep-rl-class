## Assignment Environment and Installation Instructions
Assignment 0 is posted [here](https://campuswire.com/c/G7204E992/feed/2) which will use Google colab for the coding portion. Future assigment environments will be released soon.

## Collaboration Policy
Collaboration is encouraged, but the work you submit for assignments is expected to be entirely your own. That is, the writing and code must be yours, and you must fully understand everything that you hand in. Discussing the details of how to solve a problem is fine, but you must write the solution yourself. To avoid plagiarizing, you shouldn't be looking at someone else's solution while you write down your own. If you collaborated significantly (use your own discretion for "significantly") on a problem, list the people you collaborated with next to your solution.

## Final Project
* Project proposals (1 page) will be due on 10/9.
* Maximum (and recommended) team size is 2.
* Final presentations of all projects will take place on 12/10.
